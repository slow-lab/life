    <h1>about us</h1>

    <h3>At the intersection between the slow movement and low-tech, Slow lab is a collective which wants to bring awareness and promote a resilient lifestyle.

<br>We organize social events and create artefacts to open conversations around how to integrate ancient techniques into our present context.

<br>We question and redesign the tools we use in our daily life to become less dependent on high-technology.

‚Äç<br><br>We started developing this project during our Master in Design for Emergent Futures at IAAC x FabLab BCN x Elisava</h3>
